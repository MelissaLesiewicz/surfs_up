## Overview
W. Avy would like to open a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu. The initial request was to determine precipitation and temperature trends on the island for the year. After determining that year round averages were favorable to opening a surf and ice cream shop, he wanted more information regarding the difference in temperatures during the year. I was asked to provide statistical data about the temperature diffences between June & December to see if a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year round.

##Results
 - Average temperatures are similar between June and December; 74.9 and 71.04, respectively.
 - Minimum temperatures are quite different between June and December; 64 and 56, respectively.
 - Maximum temperatures are pretty similar between June and December; 85 and 83, respectively.

##Summary
###Conclusion:
The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures do not wildly vary between June and December. The standard deviation for both sets of data are pretty similar at 3.25 and 3.74. June's middle 50% (2nd & 3rd quartiles) of temps are between 73 & 77 degrees while the middle 50% temperatures in December are between 69 and 74 degrees. This shows that tempuratures are pretty consistent year round and that temperatures rarely get so cold that people would not want ice cream. 

###Other thoughts:
Before commiting we should look at precipitation variances between months as people may not want to surf or enjoy ice cream durning a rainy season. We should also look at the elevation of the various weather stations that are collecting the data. It isn't very beneficial to gather weather data from the mountains if your shop is on the beach. We should look at the temperature trends at all stations except USC00516128 & USC00518838 as they are 152.4 and 306.6 feet above mean sea level. Those stations could be skewing our data for a surf and ice cream shop on the beach.
